In this project, I learned to integrate Tavily and Google API keys to fetch and display informations as per the user queries. 
You can make a .env file where you can add the Tavily and Google API keys as:
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_api_key_here

Using Streamlit, I created an interactive web interface where users can input queries and receive real-time responses. Additionally, I have also utilized langchain, its functions, agents, and tools effectively throughout the project.
