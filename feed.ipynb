A survey of economists showed disagreement about whether the increasing use of robots and AI will cause a substantial increase in long-term unemployment, but they generally agree that it could be a net benefit if productivity gains are redistributed.[198] Risk estimates vary; for example, in the 2010s Michael Osborne and Carl Benedikt Frey estimated 47% of U.S. jobs are at \"high risk\" of potential automation, while an OECD report classified only 9% of U.S. jobs as \"high risk\".[q][200] The methodology of speculating about future employment levels has been criticised as lacking evidential foundation, and for implying that technology (rather than social policy) creates unemployment (as opposed to redundancies).[196]\\nUnlike previous waves of automation, many middle-class jobs may be eliminated by artificial intelligence; The Economist stated in 2015 that \"the worry that AI could do to white-collar jobs what steam power did to blue-collar ones during the Industrial Revolution\" is \"worth taking seriously\".[201] Jobs at extreme risk range from paralegals to fast food cooks, while job demand is likely to increase for care-related professions ranging from personal healthcare to the clergy.[202]\\nIn April 2023, it was reported that 70% of the jobs for Chinese video game illlustrators had been eliminated by generative artificial intelligence.[203][204]\\nIt has been argued AI will become so powerful that humanity may irreversibly lose control of it. The reason that deep learning performs so well in so many applications is not known as of 2023.[112]\\nThe sudden success of deep learning in 2012–2015 did not occur because of some new discovery or theoretical breakthrough (deep neural networks and backpropagation had been described by many people, as far back as the 1950s)[j]\\nbut because of two factors: the incredible increase in computer power (including the hundred-fold increase in speed by switching to GPUs) and the availability of vast amounts of training data, especially the giant curated datasets used for benchmark testing, such as ImageNet.[k]\\nSpecialized hardware and software\\nIn the late 2010s, graphics processing units (GPUs) that were increasingly designed with AI-specific enhancements and used with specialized TensorFlow software, had replaced previously used central processing unit (CPUs) as the dominant means for large-scale (commercial and academic) machine learning models\\' training.[121]\\nHistorically, specialized languages, such as Lisp, Prolog, and others, had been used.\\n AI researchers have devised a number of tools to solve these problems using methods from probability theory and economics.[83]\\nBayesian networks[84]\\nare a very general tool that can be used for many problems, including reasoning (using the Bayesian inference algorithm),[g][86]\\nlearning (using the expectation-maximization algorithm),[h][88]\\nplanning (using decision networks)[89]\\nand perception (using dynamic Bayesian networks).[90]\\nProbabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering, prediction, smoothing and finding explanations for streams of data, helping perception systems to analyze processes that occur over time (e.g., hidden Markov models or Kalman filters).[90]\\nPrecise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan, using decision theory, decision analysis,[91]\\nand information value theory.[92]\\nThese tools include models such as Markov decision processes,\\n[93]\\ndynamic decision networks,[90]\\ngame theory and mechanism design.[94]\\nClassifiers and statistical learning methods\\nThe simplest AI applications can be divided into two types: classifiers (e.g. \"if shiny then diamond\"), on one hand, and controllers (e.g. \"if diamond then pick up\"), on the other hand. \"[ae]\\nSearle counters this assertion with his Chinese room argument, which attempts to show that, even if a machine perfectly simulates human behavior, there is still no reason to suppose it also has a mind.[292]\\nIf a machine has a mind and subjective experience, then it may also have sentience (the ability to feel), and if so it could also suffer; it has been argued that this could entitle it to certain rights.[293]\\nAny hypothetical robot rights would lie on a spectrum with animal rights and human rights.[294]\\nThis issue has been considered in fiction for centuries,[295]\\nand is now being considered by, for example, California\\'s Institute for the Future; however, critics argue that the discussion is premature.[296]\\nFuture\\nSuperintelligence and the singularity\\nA superintelligence is a hypothetical agent that would possess intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human mind.[284]\\n'}, {'url': 'https://pg-p.ctme.caltech.edu/blog/ai-ml/what-is-artificial-intelligence', 'content': 'AI technology enables computers to analyze vast amounts of data, recognize patterns, and solve complex problems without explicit programming.
